# Anthonys Portfolio

## Description
This is a quick mock-up of my future coding portfolio. The header is just my name aligned with a head shot of me. The header 2 is a description of what the page is about, and the paragraph is a little about me. Each box within the flex is going to be an eventual link to my future projects to show my work.
